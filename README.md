PyBank Python Homework
For this assigment, we created a Python script to analyze financial records of a company using financial data from a csv file.
I calculated the following, per instructions:
- the total number of months in the dataset
- the net total amount of profit and losses over the entire period
- the changes in the profit and loss from month to month over the period and the average of the changes
- the greatest increase in profits over the period
- the greatest decrease in losses over the period
