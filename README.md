PyBank Python Homework

This assignment consisted of two challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. 

For **PyBank**, we created a Python script to analyze financial records of a fictional company using a provided csv file. The csv file (budget_data.csv) is composed of two columns, 
Date and Profit/Losses.  We calculated the following from this file:

*The total number of months included in the dataset.*

*The net total amount of Profit/ Loss over the entire period.*

*The changes in Profit/Loss over the entire period and the average of those changes.*

*The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the period.*

*The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the period.*

The final script printed an analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.

For **PyPoll**, we created a Python script to analyze voting records of a fictional town using a provided csv file. The csv file (election_data.csv) is composed of three columns:
Voter ID, County, and Candidate.  

We calculated the following from this file:

*The total number of votes cast.*

*A complete list of candidates who received votes.*

*Percentage of votes for each candidate.*

*Total number of votes for each candidate.*

*Winner of the election, based on the popular vote.*


The final script printed an analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.
